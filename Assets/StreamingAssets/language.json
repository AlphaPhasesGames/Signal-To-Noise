    "stage1IntroText5": "You can walk over there with WASD or the arrow keys. If you want to interact with the world, you can use the left mouse button on the touchpad or mouse.",
    "stage1IntroText6": "Excellent work! Before we check out the incoming message. Let's talk about digital and analog signals.",
    "stage1IntroText7": "A digital signal is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values.",
    "stage1IntroText8": "An analog signal is a voltage, current, or physical quantity that continuously and infinitely varies in accordance with a time-varying parameter.",
    "stage1IntroText9": "The major difference between both signals is that analog signals have continuous electrical signals, while digital signals have non-continuous electrical signals.",

    "stage1IntroText10a": "1: Technologies make it possible to receive and decode digitized information. 2: Digital signals are either on or off.",
    "stage1IntroText11": "Some examples of technologies that use digital signals are cell phones, smartwatches, and even the average PC keyboard.",
    "stage1IntroText12": "Some examples of analog signals are radio waves, television waves, sound waves and the average wall clock.",
    "stage1IntroText13": "Looks like the message we received is encrypted and needs an employee badge to decode. We need to find one somewhere in this room.",
    "stage1IntroText14": "Also, can you find a piece of digital technology that will allow us to type a reply?",
    "stage1IntroText15": "Can you find both of these items now? To pick up an item, simply click it with the left mouse button on the touchpad or mouse.",
    "stage1IntroText16": "No, this is an analog device, we need a digital one. Try again.",
    "stage1IntroText17": "Excellent this keyboard is digital and just what we need.",

    "stage1IntroText6": "Excellent work! Before we check out the incoming message. Let's talk about digital and analog signals.",
    "stage1IntroText7": "A digital signal is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values.",
    "stage1IntroText8": "An analog signal is a voltage, current, or physical quantity that continuously and infinitely varies in accordance with a time-varying parameter.",
    "stage1IntroText9": "The major difference between both signals is that analog signals have continuous electrical signals, while digital signals have non-continuous electrical signals.",
    "stage1IntroText10": "2 important things to know about digital signals.",

    "stage1IntroText14": "Also, can you find a piece of digital technology that will allow us to type a reply?",
    "stage1IntroText15": "Can you find both of these items now? To pick up an item, simply click it with the left mouse button on the touchpad or mouse.",
    "stage1IntroText16": "Excellent this keyboard is digital and just what we need.",
    "stage1IntroText17": "No, this old TV is an analog device, we need a digital device that will allow to type a reply. Try again.",
    "stage1IntroText18": "There is nothing in this locker. Try another!",

    "stage1IntroText22": "To use a held object, simply move the mouse over the thing you want to use it on and click the left mouse button, on the mouse or touchpad.",
    "stage1IntroText23": "Did you know that digital information can maintain quality over a long-distance transmission, as opposed to analog signals.",
    "stage1IntroText23a": "Excellent work! A long range, digital message is coming through on the screen. Can you find the message on screen?",
    "stage1IntroText24": "Hello Space Station 80. I have messaged to inform you that I left you some digital devices in the crews quarters, just in the next room. Have a look.",
    "stage1IntroText25": "This message has come from 200 light years away. We can respond with a digital signal or an analog signal.",
    "stage1IntroText25a": "Remember that we need to transmit this message over a long distance, so we need to send the correct type of signal.",
    "stage1IntroText25b": "Can you search the console and look for the correct method of response?",
    "stage1IntroText26": "Thank you. I’ll check them out when I next get a break.",
    "stage1IntroText27": "Devices? Awesome! I hope one of them is the R-Pad 9000!",
    "stage1IntroText28": "I'll have a look soon. I'm really busy. Thanks though!",
    "stage1IntroText29": "Before we go check out the new devices. We need to find out if it’s break time.",
    "stage1IntroText30": "Somewhere around the bridge is an analog clock. Can you find it please and get the time?",
    "stage1IntroText31": "This is a clock but it's digital. Try again!",
    "stage1IntroText32": "Excellent this wall mounted clock is an analog device. And it’s time for our break! Let's head to the door and explore the crew quarters.",
    "stage1IntroText33AnaMessage": "If we use an analog signal, the message will degrade before it reaches the ship. Try looking again!",
    "stage1IncorrectSpeakerItem": "This clock is digital but it won’t help us reply to the message on the console. Try again!",
    "stage1IncorrectClockItem": "These are analog speakers and won’t help us reply to the message. Try again!",    
    "stage2IntroText1": "It's so dark in here, how will we find the devices that Robot 80 left us?",
    "stage2IntroText2": "We need to turn on the light. Light switches also come in digital and analog forms.",
    "stage2IntroText3": "Can you search the room for a digital light switch? Ill turn on our chest torch",
    "stage2IntroText4": "Excellent. This light switch is digital. How strange, the light didn't turn on. Can you find an analog light switch, please?",
    "stage2IntroText5": "Oh, fantastic. The lights are on. Let's search for those devices.",
    "stage2IntroText6": "It is important to know, that modern technologies use digitized signals as a reliable way to encode and transmit information.",
    "stage2IntroText7": "Can you find 3 modern digital devices around the crew quarters?",
    "stage2IntroText8": "Excellent a digital smartphone.",
    "stage2IntroText9": "Fantastic. A digital tablet.",
    "stage2IntroText10": "Oh wonderful, a smartwatch.",
    "stage2IntroText11": "Did you know that Information can be stored on various types of devices? ",
    "stage2IntroText12": "That's all 3 devices. Oh, there is a message on the smartwatch. Let’s take a closer look!",
    "stage2IntroText13WatchMessage1": "Hey dude. There is a new security system stopping you from getting into the communication deck.",
    "stage2IntroText14WatchMessage2": "I left the code somewhere on this device. You will need to have a look through its files and find it.",
    "stage2IntroText15": "Thanks dude  I'll have a look now!",
    "stage2IntroText16": "Oh great, more security! Thanks for the code.",
    "stage2IntroText17": "Thank you. I hope it's easier to remember than the last one.",
    "stage2IntroText18": "Excellent. Let's enter the code by the exit door and check out the communication deck.",
    "stage2IntroText19DoorCorrect": "That’s the correct code, the door is unlocked. Lets head to the communications room.",
    "stage2IntroText20": "Oh, that code didn’t work. Let’s check out the smartwatch again!",
    "stage2IntroText21": "This old computer is an analog device. We’re looking for modern devices. Try again!",
    "stage2IntroText22": "These VHS tapes are analog media.  We're looking for more modern devices. Try again!",
    "stage3IntroText1": "Welcome to the communication room. Here we will take a closer look at digital communications in greater detail.",
    "stage3IntroText2": "Before we progress you should know that some communication involves the use of digital signals.",
    "stage3IntroText3": "There is an incoming digital message on the center console. Let's check it out.",
    "stage3IntroText4": "Hey boss. I'm on my way to take over your shift. I'll be docking shortly.",
    "stage3IntroText5": "Can you please get to the cargo bay and open the hanger doors?",
    "stage3IntroText6": "I’ve sent over the security codes for the safe.",
    "stage3IntroText7": "Inside you should find the keycard to the hanger bay.",
    "stage3IntroText8": "I’ve encrypted the safe combination in Morse code. You’ll need to find a way to decrypt it.",
    "stage3IntroText9": "There should be some folders around the communications deck to help you out.",
    "stage3IntroText9a": "Each folder should have part of the decoding document. Try and collect them all!",
    "stage3IntroText10": "I’ll leave the code on your communications console, for when you're ready.",
    "stage3IntroText11": "We should reply but need to use a long-distance reply. Can you search the console and find the correct way to respond, please?",
    "stage3IntroText12R1": "I’ll get the key and head to the cargo bay now. See you soon!",
    "stage3IntroText13R2": "Thanks for letting me know, Im looking forward to a day off!",
    "stage3IntroText14R3": "I hope the cargo bay is tidy. I'll check when I get in there.",
    "stage3IntroText15": "Morse code is a great example of how digital signals can be sent as wave pulses, such as pulses of light or electricity.",
    "stage3IntroText16": "Take a look around the communication deck and see if you can find the document folders with Morse code inside.",
    "stage3IntroText17": "Yes. This sounds and looks like Morse code.",
    "stage3IntroText18": "Let’s head back to the console and decode our safe combination.",
    "stage3IntroText19": "This is not Morse code. Keep looking!",
    "stage3IntroText20": "Use the decoding document to decode the Morse code and get the safe combination.",
    "stage3IntroText21": "Enter the safe code here.",
    "stage3IntroText22": "That is not correct, head back to the console and decode the Morse code again.",
    "stage3IntroText23": "Excellent, the safe is open. Let's get to the cargo deck.",
    "stage3IntroText24": "Excellent. Let’s use this key on the door!",
    "stage3IntroTextMorseCodeDoc1": "Excellent, we found the numbers 1 to 3 in Morse code.",
    "stage3IntroTextMorseCodeDoc2": "Amazing, these are the numbers 4 to 7 in Morse code.",
    "stage3IntroTextMorseCodeDoc3": "Fantastic. These are the numbers 8 to 0 in Morse code.",
    "stage3IntroTextMorseCodeComplete": "That’s the entire document collected. Let’s decipher the safe combination on the main console.",    
    "stage4IntroText1": "Welcome to the space dock. Our task here is to help the approaching ship land.",
    "stage4IntroText2": "We have a digital message on our smart tablet. Please take a look, when you get a moment.",
    "stage4IntroText3": "Did you know that digital information can be stored without significant degradation, as opposed to analog information?",
    "stage4IntroText4": "The digital message on our tablet is safely stored inside the memory of the device and will stay there until the device falls into disrepair.",

    "stage5IntroText2": "We need to talk to the pilot but first, we should talk about analog signals.",
    "stage5IntroText3": "Analog signals vary continuously.",
    "stage5IntroText4": "A good example of an analog signal is the human voice. Talking use air to vibrate the vocal cords and create sounds that vary in tone and pitch.",
    "stage5IntroText5": "Let's put this to the test and talk to the pilot.",

    "stage1IntroText6": "Excellent work! Before we check out the incoming message. Let's talk about digital and analog signals.",
    "stage1IntroText7": "A digital signal is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values.",
    "stage1IntroText8": "An analog signal is a voltage, current, or physical quantity that continuously and infinitely varies in accordance with a time-varying parameter.",
    "stage1IntroText9": "The major difference between both signals is that analog signals have continuous electrical signals, while digital signals have non-continuous electrical signals.",

    "stage2IntroText5": "Oh, fantastic. The lights are on. Let's search for those devices.",
    "stage2IntroText6": "It is important to know, that modern technologies use digitized signals as a reliable way to encode and transmit information.",
    "stage2IntroText7": "Can you find 3 modern digital devices around the crew quarters?",
    "stage2IntroText8": "Excellent a digital smartphone.",
    "stage2IntroText9": "Fantastic. A digital tablet.",
    "stage2IntroText10": "Oh wonderful, a smartwatch.",
    "stage2IntroText11": "Did you know that Information can be stored on various types of devices? ",
    "stage2IntroText12": "That's all 3 devices. Oh, there is a message on the smartwatch. Let’s take a closer look!",
    "stage2IntroText13WatchMessage1": "Hey dude. There is a new security system stopping you from getting into the communication deck.",

    "stage3IntroText1": "Welcome to the communication room. Here we will take a closer look at digital communications in greater detail.",
    "stage3IntroText2": "Before we progress you should know that some communication involves the use of digital signals.",
    "stage3IntroText3": "There is an incoming digital message on the center console. Let's check it out.",
    "stage3IntroText4": "Hey boss. I'm on my way to take over your shift. I'll be docking shortly.",
    "stage3IntroText5": "Can you please get to the cargo bay and open the hanger doors?",
    "stage3IntroText6": "I’ve sent over the security codes for the safe.",
    "stage3IntroText7": "Inside you should find the keycard to the hanger bay.",
    "stage3IntroText8": "I’ve encrypted the safe combination in Morse code. You’ll need to find a way to decrypt it.",
    "stage3IntroText9": "There should be some folders around the communications deck to help you out.",
    "stage3IntroText9a": "Each folder should have part of the decoding document. Try and collect them all!",
    "stage3IntroText10": "I’ll leave the code on your communications console, for when you're ready.",
    "stage3IntroText11": "We should reply but need to use a long-distance reply. Can you search the console and find the correct way to respond, please?",
    "stage3IntroText12R1": "I’ll get the key and head to the cargo bay now. See you soon!",
    "stage3IntroText13R2": "Thanks for letting me know, Im looking forward to a day off!",
    "stage3IntroText14R3": "I hope the cargo bay is tidy. I'll check when I get in there.",
    "stage3IntroText15": "Morse code is a great example of how digital signals can be sent as wave pulses, such as pulses of light or electricity.",
    "stage3IntroText16": "Take a look around the communication deck and see if you can find the document folders with Morse code inside.",
    "stage3IntroText17": "Yes. This sounds and looks like Morse code.",
    "stage3IntroText18": "Let’s head back to the console and decode our safe combination.",
    "stage3IntroText19": "This is not Morse code. Keep looking!",
    "stage3IntroText20": "Use the decoding document to decode the Morse code and get the safe combination.",
    "stage3IntroText21": "Enter the safe code here.",
    "stage3IntroText22": "That is not correct, head back to the console and decode the Morse code again.",
    "stage3IntroText23": "Excellent, the safe is open. Let's get to the cargo deck.",
    "stage3IntroText24": "Excellent. Let’s use this key on the door!",
    "stage3IntroTextMorseCodeDoc1": "Excellent, we found the numbers 1 to 3 in Morse code.",
    "stage3IntroTextMorseCodeDoc2": "Amazing, these are the numbers 4 to 7 in Morse code.",
    "stage3IntroTextMorseCodeDoc3": "Fantastic. These are the numbers 8 to 0 in Morse code.",

    "stage4IntroText1": "Welcome to the space dock. Our task here is to help the approaching ship land.",
    "stage4IntroText2": "We have a digital message on our smart tablet. Please take a look, when you get a moment.",
    "stage4IntroText3": "Did you know that digital information can be stored without significant degradation, as opposed to analog information?",
    "stage4IntroText4": "The digital message on our tablet is safely stored inside the memory of the device and will stay there until the device falls into disrepair.",
    "stage4IntroText5": "Hey dude. I’m coming into dock my ship.",
    "stage4IntroText6": "Oh no, someone has encoded the landing coordinates into binary.",

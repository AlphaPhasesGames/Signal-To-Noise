    "stage1IntroText23a": "Excellent work! A long range, digital message is coming through on the screen. Can you find the message on screen?",
    "stage1IntroText24": "Hello Space Station 80. I have messaged to inform you that I left you some digital devices in the crews quarters, just in the next room. Have a look.",

    "stage1IntroText31": "This is a clock but it's digital. Try again!",

    "stage1IntroText33AnaMessage": "If we use an analog signal, the message will degrade before it reaches the ship. Try looking again!",
    "stage1IntroText34": "If you want to drop an object. You can press right-click or the escape button.",
    "stage1IncorrectSpeakerItem": "This clock is digital but it won’t help us reply to the message on the console. Try again!",

    "stage2IntroText3": "Can you search the room for a digital light switch? I'll turn on our chest torch!",
    "stage2IntroText4": "Excellent. This light switch is digital. How strange, the light didn't turn on. Can you find an analog light switch, please?",
    "stage2IntroText5": "Oh, fantastic. The lights are on. Let's search for those devices.",
    "stage2IntroText6": "It is important to know, that modern technologies use digitized signals as a reliable way to encode and transmit information.",
